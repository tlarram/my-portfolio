        <span>Hello! My name is Timothy Larramore, and I am a full stack web developer.  I have a background in education as a teacher and assistant principal.  
            I decided to take those soft skills and move to a new job field.  I have a passion for developing web pages and spending time solving real-world problems. This web page is an example of my skills as well as a
            way to get to know a little about me.  I want to create web projects as a full stack developer.  When I am not coding, I am a simple man.  I enjoy playing video games, reading books, and spending time with my family. </span>
